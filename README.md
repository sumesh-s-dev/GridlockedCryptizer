# GridlockedCryptizer
GridlockedCryptizer is a simple and secure file encryption-decryption tool built using Java and MySQL. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text-based data using a customized grid-based cipher and stores user data securely in a database. This project was developed as part of my BCA final year project
